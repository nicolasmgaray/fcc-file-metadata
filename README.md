<h3>User stories</h3>

1. I can submit a form that includes a file upload.
2. The form file input field  has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response

<h3>Live Example</h3>

* Go to [https://fcc-file-metadata-challenge.glitch.me/](https://fcc-file-metadata-challenge.glitch.me/), and upload a file using the provided form.
